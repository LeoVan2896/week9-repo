Angular/front-end development is the part that I feel pround of the most. Since almost everything that we had done here, we figured out and built together as a team with minimum help from outside.
Challenges that we faces are: - Trying to create relationship between entities, syntax error at both back-end and front-end; create and establish project on AWS and try to make them work.
I think we will try to make our project work on AWS and then make our web-page look better.
I will divide the task and time for each task differently so we can finish all the tasks asap and then come back to make our web-app look better.
I wish I know all the technologies that we need to build the project so we can make everything much better and smoother.
Since we had learn everything that we need to build so we can divide the tasks evenly and work on them, progress faster since we have better understanding about Spring-boot and Anguler.
